## Background ##
We started this project as a schoolassignment to create a webapplication with a databaseconnection. In the planning process, we got inspired by a orienteering website where you check in to checkpoints via googlemaps. We took that idea with a spin-off where a user can upload their own places on the map and upload photos on that location. The geogallery was born.
